\label{sec:conc}


The approach described in this paper has produced state of the art results on a variety of datasets. 
But it comes with its own set of disadvantages. There are many hyperparameters to consider, like the number of clusters, the value of K or the transformation for self-supervised training. Also the algorithm performs less than optimally for large class sizes and these can be observed in the case of ImageNet dataset. Still the paper paves the way for new and better unsupervised image classification models.
